# CeleraV2
This is a roblox executor that allows you to execute on the website instead of downloading microsoft roblox and playing on 60 fps capped.
Celera is NOW updated to V2 after a long year of disappearance. 
Steps to download;

1. Turn off Anti-Virus protection. Why you may ask? Because this is an EXE file. This file is unoffical and will be detected since it is an exploit.
2. Run CeleraV2
3. Enjoy.


Id advise to not play on your main. Whatever happens to your account is YOUR responsibility.
